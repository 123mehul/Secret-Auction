# Auction Bidding Program

This program implements a simple auction bidding system in Python. It allows multiple participants to place bids and determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

# Features

Accepts multiple bids from users.

Records the name and bid amount of each participant.

Dynamically determines the winner with the highest bid.

Allows the bidding process to continue until no further bids are submitted.

Utilizes a console-clearing function to ensure a clean interface during bidding (requires the replit module).

# How It Works

Users are prompted to enter their name and bid amount.

The program stores each bid in a dictionary.

At the end of the bidding process, the program identifies the highest bid and announces the winner.
